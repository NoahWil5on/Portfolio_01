            <h1><strong>Battle Bases</strong></h1>
            <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .7); text-align: left;">Battle Bases is a real-time online multiplayer game
                built with JavaScript, NodeJS, and SocketIO. Two players are pitted against eachother in an arena where they
                must build units, upgrade their base, and manage their resources in hopes of destroying the opponents base.
                The project highlights functionalities like gamestates, lobbies, and host/client relations, as well as a
                style of graphic design I'm less familiar with. I'm especially proud of how the structure/layout of the project
                turned out, There was a ton of code reuse because I spent some time before the project to plan out how I
                would manage the 52 indidvidual art pieces for this project and all of the unique properties of army units
                with their indidvidual upgrades.</p>
